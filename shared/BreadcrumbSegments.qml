// Breadcrumb row (path segments) -- fifteenth component
// extracted from core, shared between the active and background panels.
// Previously they were two nearly identical Repeaters (breadcrumbRow and bgBreadcrumbRow)
// that compared each segment against a different "current" path depending on the
// panel -- here that "current" is a single parameter (activePath) that the caller
// already resolves (root.currentPath or bgPanel.modelData.path). The active
// panel still has, outside this component, the MouseArea and the
// TextField to edit the path by hand -- the background one does not need them.
